            <p1>
               &emsp; &emsp; Hii all, this is to inform you that the website is mainly focused on bakkery stuff like a
               chat,sweets, crunchies and cakes . In March 2020, Tarts de Feybesse was reborn to supply sourdough levain to 
               their Glen Cove Vallejo community during the COVID-19 pandemic. Chef and owners, Paul and Monique Feybesse 
               quickly incorporated a pastries menu and more. Beloved in the Bay Area, guests can visit the website to browse menus,
               inquire about catering and view home delivery opportunities.

        <h2>Bakkeries and Sweets</h2>
        <p2>
            &emsp; &emsp; Bakers' confectionery, also called flour confections, includes principally sweet pastries, cakes, and similar baked goods.
            Baker's confectionery excludes everyday breads, and thus is a subset of products produced by a baker.Sugar confectionery includes candies 
            (also called sweets, short for sweetmeats,[4] in many English-speaking countries), candied nuts, chocolates, chewing gum, bubble gum, pastillage,
             and other confections that are made primarily of sugar. In some cases, chocolate confections (confections made of chocolate) are treated as a 
             separate category, as are sugar-free versions of sugar confections.[5] The words candy (Canada & US), sweets (UK, Ireland, and others), 
             and lollies (Australia and New Zealand) are common words for some of the most popular varieties of sugar confectionery.
